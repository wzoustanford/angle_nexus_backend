Based on the user intention The inquiry focuses on three companies – Nvidia, Netflix, and Walmart – although the reference to building personal computer or enterprise operating systems might not directly apply to all three. 

• Company Identification – Nvidia is known for its graphics and AI computing platforms; Netflix is a streaming leader; Walmart remains a dominant retail force with increasing digital initiatives. 

• Leadership – Nvidia's leadership, under CEO Jensen Huang, emphasizes innovative technologies, especially in AI and gaming. Netflix's leadership, guided by CEO Ted Sarandos and co-CEO Greg Peters, has driven subscriber growth via content innovation. Walmart, led by CEO Doug McMillon, leverages its vast operational expertise and digital transformation to sustain market leadership. 

• Growth Potential – Nvidia shows strong growth potential due to its position in high-performance computing and AI. Netflix continues to expand globally, although facing stiff competition and content-licensing pressures. Walmart is evolving its business model to integrate e-commerce and remain competitive in a rapidly changing retail environment. 

• Debt Risk – Nvidia generally maintains a disciplined balance sheet with moderate debt levels supporting its growth. Netflix has historically carried higher leverage linked to its content spend, although revenue growth helps mitigate this risk. Walmart, being a mature company, holds debt as part of its capital structure, with steady cash flows supporting its debt obligations. 

• Portfolio Expansion – In addition to these candidates, investors might consider companies that complement enterprise operating systems and technology trends such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Microsoft offers a robust ecosystem in operating systems, cloud services, and enterprise software, while Apple continues to excel in personal computing and integrated devices, both offering potentially attractive growth and stable financials. 

This multi-faceted analysis covers leadership, growth, debt metrics, and suggestions for portfolio diversification aligned with the emerging trends in technology and retail sectors.
